# ie-titanic-utils
Sample project for Python Workshop (IE MBD)

(Full description to be completed)

(With extra information)

## Solutions

1. VERY BAD: "*Just go to `/workspace/ie-titanic-utils`* "
    - Con: Your users will start polluting everything

2. QUITE BAD: I send the file (`str_utils.py`) and the user puts it in their working directory
    - If they're working on several directories
    - You don't control the code anymore

3. BAD: Change `sys.path`
    -Users use the development version

4. EXCELLENT: We'll see that in next sessions
